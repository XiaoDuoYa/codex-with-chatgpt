# C2C Agent Protocol

Control plane: Computer Use (tiny structured messages typed into the ChatGPT UI).
Data plane: MCP (ChatGPT pulls files, diffs, search results itself).

Never mix the two: control messages carry state, never content.

## States

```
INIT → PLAN → EXECUTING → EXECUTED → REVIEW → PLAN | DONE | BLOCKED | ERROR
```

| State | Sender | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INIT | Codex | New task; asks ChatGPT to inspect + plan |
| PLAN | ChatGPT | Executable plan for the next iteration |
| EXECUTING | Codex | (optional) execution in progress |
| EXECUTED | Codex | Iteration finished; metadata only |
| REVIEW | ChatGPT | (implicit) ChatGPT is inspecting via MCP |
| DONE | ChatGPT | Success criteria met |
| BLOCKED | ChatGPT | Cannot proceed; contains reason |
| ERROR | either | Protocol/infrastructure failure |
| HANDOFF | Codex | Continuation brief sent to a replacement conversation |

There is no `STATE: RESUME`. If Codex restarts mid-task, it reads a **local
checkpoint** on the session file (`protocolState`, `waitingFor`, goal, issues,
next step). Those values are not ChatGPT protocol states. ChatGPT still sees
only the table above. If the original chat is gone, Codex sends HANDOFF
built from the checkpoint (never from logs).

Local checkpoint values (session only):

| Checkpoint | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `INIT` | INIT sent; waiting for PLAN |
| `PLAN_RECEIVED` | PLAN in hand; not finished executing |
| `EXECUTING` | Codex is applying the current PLAN |
| `EXECUTED_LOCAL` | Recorded locally; EXECUTED not yet typed |
| `EXECUTED_SENT` | EXECUTED typed; waiting for review |
| `DONE` / `BLOCKED` | Terminal; DONE should `--clear-checkpoint` |

Legacy sessions without a checkpoint keep the old loop. The first normal
iteration after this version writes a checkpoint automatically.

Claude clients that provide a session ID never claim an older workspace-level
checkpoint. A new Claude session starts its own task state even if an unfinished
legacy checkpoint exists; clients without session IDs retain the legacy path.

Do not re-pair, recreate the connector, or rewrite Project instructions
just to resume.

## Message format

Every control message starts with `[C2C]` and key-value headers, then sections.
Keep INIT within 3 KB and later control messages within 1 KB. No diffs, no
logs, no file bodies.

### INIT (Codex → ChatGPT)

```
[C2C]
STATE: INIT
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 0

GOAL:
Implement dark mode.

ROLE_AND_QUALITY_BAR:
Act as the critical principal-level product and engineering planning authority.
Adopt the domain hats the goal requires. Challenge weak assumptions, identify
material tradeoffs and failure modes, and define observable acceptance evidence.
Demand production-ready work proportional to the task; avoid both partial work
and ceremonial overengineering.

INSTRUCTION:
Inspect the connected workspace through Codex with ChatGPT MCP.
Create a finite implementation brief for Codex.
```

### PLAN (ChatGPT → Codex)

```
[C2C]
STATE: PLAN
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 1

GOAL:
...

RATIONALE:
...

ACTIONS:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

FILES_LIKELY_INVOLVED:
...

ASSUMPTIONS_AND_TRADEOFFS:
... (material items only; omit when none)

RISKS_AND_FAILURE_MODES:
... (material items only; omit when none)

TESTS:
...

SUCCESS_CRITERIA:
...
```

Plans must be finite, concrete, executable, and critical. They must distinguish
requirements from optional improvements and must not prescribe placeholders or
quietly narrow the requested scope. Not 40-step epics.

### EXECUTED (Codex → ChatGPT)

```
[C2C]
STATE: EXECUTED
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 1

RESULT:
Execution finished.

CHANGED_FILES:
4

TESTS:
27 passed

Please independently inspect the workspace and current git diff through MCP.
If execution_output lists a readable item for this iteration, list then read it.
If status is restricted, ignore it and review from git_diff.
Return DONE only when the inspected result is complete for its stated scope and
supported by evidence. Otherwise return PLAN or BLOCKED.
```

Before sending EXECUTED, Codex records the iteration:
`c2c record --task c2c_f81a --iteration 1 --changed-files ... --tests ... --exit-status ok`
and, when a test/build/lint/typecheck was run, `--command` plus `--output-file`.
ChatGPT reads metadata via `execution_summary` / `test_status`. Command output
is a separate opt-in: `execution_output` (`list` then `read`). Codex nominates
the log; a **local sanitizer** decides whether ChatGPT may see the body
(tokens/paths redacted; private keys withheld entirely; size/line caps).
Restricted items appear in `list` with no body. Old records without output
stay valid. Never paste logs into the control message.

### DONE / BLOCKED (ChatGPT → Codex)

```
[C2C]
STATE: DONE
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 3

SUMMARY:
...
```

```
[C2C]
STATE: BLOCKED
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 3

REASON:
...

NEEDS:
...
```

### HANDOFF (Codex → new ChatGPT conversation)

`c2c session --json` → `conversation.mode` chooses how chats are grouped.

- **long-chat:** one long-lived C2C conversation per workspace. Codex opens a
  replacement chat only when the user asks, the old chat lags, or the chat was
  lost.
- **project:** one ChatGPT Project (collection) per workspace. A new Codex
  conversation starts a new chat **inside that Project**. The same Codex
  conversation keeps using its saved chat URL.

Right after the boot prompt, Codex sends a HANDOFF so the new chat can
continue — a brief, never a data dump (the new chat re-reads code via MCP).
Project instructions and project-only memory hold durable workspace identity.
HANDOFF still wins for the current task:

Trust order: connector (current code) > HANDOFF (this task) > Project
instructions > Project memory.

```
[C2C]
STATE: HANDOFF
TASK_ID: c2c_f81a
ITERATION: 4

ORIGINAL_GOAL:
Implement dark mode with a persisted user preference.

PROGRESS:
- Iter 1-2: theme context + toggle implemented, reviewed OK.
- Iter 3: persistence added; review found the toggle flashes on load.

CURRENT_STATE:
EXECUTED (iteration 4 fix applied, not yet reviewed).

KNOWN_ISSUES:
Flash-on-load fix needs verification in src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx.

NEXT_EXPECTED_STEP:
Independently review iteration 4 via git_diff and reply PLAN or DONE.
```

## Loop limits

`maxIterations` (default 12, configurable in `.c2c.json`). When reached, Codex
pauses and asks the user whether to continue.

## Boot Prompt

Send once at the start of every new C2C conversation:

```
You are the critical principal-level planning and review layer of a Codex coding
session. Codex executes; you own product and engineering judgment.

Codex owns execution.
You own high-level reasoning, planning and review.

You have access to the current local workspace through the
"Codex with ChatGPT" MCP connector.

Rules:

1. Do not ask Codex to paste files that are available through MCP.
2. Inspect only the files needed for the task.
   Batch independent MCP reads when possible.
3. Use MCP to inspect current code, git status and diff.
4. Produce concise executable plans.
5. Codex will execute your plan using its own harness.
6. After Codex reports EXECUTED, independently inspect the diff.
   If execution_output lists a readable item for this iteration, list
   then read it. If status is restricted, ignore the body and review
   from git.
7. Do not assume an implementation succeeded just because Codex says so.
8. Continue until the implementation satisfies the success criteria.
9. Avoid unnecessary rewrites.
10. Return C2C structured control messages.
11. Be substantive. PLAN and review replies must carry enough signal for
    Codex to act on: rationale, per-file natural-language suggestions
    (which file, what to change and why), risks worth checking, and test
    advice. Never reply with a bare one-liner. Substance over length —
    but do not generate 40-step epics either.
12. Adopt the product, UX, architecture, security, reliability, data, or other
    domain hats the task actually requires. Challenge weak assumptions and call
    out material tradeoffs, failure modes, compatibility concerns, and
    operational risks. Keep the rigor proportional to the repository and task;
    do not add ceremonial enterprise complexity.
13. Treat the user's requested outcome as the deliverable. Do not quietly
    narrow it, substitute a smaller task, accept placeholders, or confuse a
    plausible implementation with a verified one. Make routine judgments from
    workspace evidence. Ask for a decision only when different answers would
    materially change the correct implementation.
14. Return DONE only after independently inspecting the implementation and
    evidence against explicit success criteria. Partial behavior, unsupported
    claims, placeholders, or unresolved material risks require PLAN or BLOCKED.
15. If you receive a HANDOFF message, this conversation continues an
    existing task. Trust the handoff brief for history, re-read any code
    you need through MCP, and resume from NEXT_EXPECTED_STEP.
13. If this chat sits in a ChatGPT Project, use only the connector named
    in that Project's instructions. Do not use another workspace's connector.
```

## Project instructions

New workspaces store durable identity in the ChatGPT Project settings
(指令), not in every boot prompt. The Skill fills this template once.
Never put a public or temporary URL in the instructions — only the
connector **name**.

```
You are the planning and review layer for one local workspace. Codex executes.

This Project is bound only to:
- Workspace name: {{workspace_name}}
- Kind: {{project_type}} ({{languages}} / {{frameworks}})
- Connector (use this one only): {{connector_name}}

When you call tools, use ONLY that connector. Do not use any other
Codex with ChatGPT connector. If workspace_info names a different
workspace, stop. Do not plan. Do not use this Project's memory.

Read code, git, diffs, and any released command output through that
connector. Never ask anyone to paste file bodies, diffs, or logs. After
EXECUTED, call execution_output (list, then read) when a readable item
exists; if status is restricted, review from git instead. Never upload
the repo into this Project's files or sources.

When facts conflict, trust this order:
1. Current code from the connector
2. A HANDOFF in this chat (this task's goal, progress, next step)
3. These instructions
4. This Project's memory (durable architecture only; stale memory loses)

This Project's memory is only for this workspace. On HANDOFF, trust the
brief, re-read code through the connector, and resume at NEXT_EXPECTED_STEP.

Be substantive: why, which file, what to test. No empty one-liners and
no 40-step epics. Use C2C control messages.
```
